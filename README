1) create a file in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties with something like:

com.rsk.apiKey=<your covalenthq api key>
com.rsk.wallet=<your rsk wallet address>

The api key should look like: ckey_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, get it by registering yourself in https://www.covalenthq.com
the second one your wallet address starting with 0x

2) go in the cmd line to this directory and run ./gradlew :run

    note: if you are developing locally I suggest you run instead: ./gradlew run --args=--classpath so that we are not querying covalenthq API every time,
    instead, the file src/main/resources/rsk.json will be used.
